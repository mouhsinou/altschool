  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Master's student in Computer Science (Master 2), with a strong academic background that started with a Bachelor's degree 
    in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am originally from Benin, born in Parakou, a city in the northern part of the country.
  </p>
  <p>
    Passionate about technology and its power to transform lives, I have always been curious about how systems work, especially those that power 
    modern web applications. My academic journey gave me solid theoretical foundations, and I now want to strengthen my practical skills 
    by focusing on backend development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I decided to deepen my knowledge in this area because backend development is the backbone of any scalable and secure application. 
    It involves databases, APIs, authentication, and performance — all things I’m eager to master. My goal is to become a skilled backend engineer, 
    capable of building reliable systems that solve real-world problems.
